Once the instance is running, you can check the Blindata Data Agent status via a browser at the public DNS provided by Amazon.

You can see the status of the agent like in the image below:
<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ImgAgent.png" style="width: 800px;">
   
</div>
