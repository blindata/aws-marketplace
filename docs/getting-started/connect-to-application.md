# Connect to the application

---

Once the instance is running, you can access the Blindata Data Governance and Compliance Platform via a browser at the public DNS provided by Amazon.

To log in to the application for the first time you can use the default user `blindata`.

To get the password check the system log on AWS Management Console or connect to the instance and check the file `/home/blindata/blindata_credentials.conf`.
